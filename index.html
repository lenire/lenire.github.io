    <p>Since the post went up yesterday, I took some steps to research the next few things on this design, since this is a living design some things will change over the next few weeks.</p>
    <p>One of the things I am really proud of is the header neon sign. This is done in pure CSS after looking through a few tutorials. I am going to try and clean up the animation and make it look more like an actual neon sign, and then apply that to some of the features in the sight, such as the Horizontal Rule tag.</p>
    <p>Most of the commits to this github repository have been CSS changes, as I figure things out and improve the style of the page.</p>
    <p>Today I spent some time doing a tutorial on my Arduino, the lesson was about making a console for your space ship. Whatever it takes it make it engaging I guess.</p>

    <p>This involved some coding from the Arduino IDE to push the code to this little device. I was really nervous as I didn't know anything was working, until I pushed the code to the device and then it lit up and worked.</p>

    <h1>Social Distancing</h1>

      Here it comes:</p>
      <p>I have been think of setting up this site for a while now but I haven't had the time. But now that we are in social distancing because of the Corona Virus, I have all the free time to work on this site.</p>
      <p>The goal of this site is to document all of the process that I am going through to learn and relearn some of the things that interest me. That is why I have decided to host in on Github Pages. </p>
      <p>The goal over the next few weeks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn my Arduino</li>
        <li>Setup My Raspberry PI</li>
        <li>Learn Git</li>
        <li>Finish Studying for the Dynamics 0365 Certificate (Test is on the 24th)</li>
        <li>Create this site and relearn how to use HTML and CSS. I am going for a CyberPunk aesthitic</li>
      </ul>
        <p>Eventually this site will move to Jekyyl as the CMS, but for the moment I am enjoying just making something simple in HTML and utilizing Sublime Text to craft the HTML and CSS like I did back and school. It is nice to have something simple and clean to work from.</p>
