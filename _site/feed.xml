&lt;p&gt;I have been playing a few video games lately, instead of working on my goals, but that is ok, as my brain did need the little bit of a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready to get back into this tho, as it appears we have 3 more months of quarantine ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I have finally started the conversion process of this baby site into Jekyll.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/site/jekyll/update/2020/05/10/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!" /><published>2020-05-10T00:01:46-05:00</published><updated>2020-05-10T00:01:46-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/site/jekyll/update/2020/05/10/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/site/jekyll/update/2020/05/10/welcome-to-jekyll.html">&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Build a Light Theremin with my Arduino and turn my Raspberry PI into a pirate radio station.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;I followed the tutorial in my book, and was able to create it in no time. It is really annoying, but it was neat to see how the photo sensor works. The next tutorial turns it into a keyboard, but I wonder if you can combine the two inputs as they make a more interesting sound.

The other big project I worked on today, was to turn my Raspberry PI into a pirate radio station. 

I used the following commands to get my Raspberry PI setup

pi@raspberrypi:~/PiFmRds/src $ history
  sudeo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo apt-get install libsox-fmt-mp3 
  sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev 
  sudo apt-get install git 
  git clone https://github.com/ChristopheJacquet/PiFmRds.git 
  cd PiFmRds/src 
  make clean 
  make
 
The following command then turned on the transmitter to get the Raspberry PI to start broadcasting: 
  sudo ./pi_fm_rds

 I do not actually have a radio setup in my home, so the Pirate Station was short lived.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I will be uploading it again, and then running my music through it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Today was two big projects for me.

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I am really proud of is the header neon sign. This is done in pure CSS after looking through a few tutorials. I am going to try and clean up the animation and make it look more like an actual neon sign, and then apply that to some of the features in the sight, such as the Horizontal Rule tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the commits to this github repository have been CSS changes, as I figure things out and improve the style of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I spent some time doing a tutorial on my Arduino, the lesson was about making a console for your space ship. Whatever it takes it make it engaging I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=&quot;imgur-embed-pub&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; data-id=&quot;a/xHkuJ2Y&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;//imgur.com/a/xHkuJ2Y&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script async src=&quot;//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This involved some coding from the Arduino IDE to push the code to this little device. I was really nervous as I didn’t know anything was working, until I pushed the code to the device and then it lit up and worked.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Since the post went up yesterday, I took some steps to research the next few things on this design, since this is a living design some things will change over the next few weeks.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Social Distancing</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/life/2020/03/19/social-distancing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Social Distancing" /><published>2020-03-19T00:01:46-05:00</published><updated>2020-03-19T00:01:46-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/life/2020/03/19/social-distancing</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/life/2020/03/19/social-distancing.html">&lt;p&gt;Here it comes:&lt;/p&gt;

  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The goal over the next few weeks:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn my Arduino&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Setup My Raspberry PI&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn Git&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Finish Studying for the Dynamics 0365 Certificate (Test is on the 24th)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Create this site and relearn how to use HTML and CSS. I am going for a CyberPunk aesthitic&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Eventually this site will move to Jekyyl as the CMS, but for the moment I am enjoying just making something simple in HTML and utilizing Sublime Text to craft the HTML and CSS like I did back and school. It is nice to have something simple and clean to work from.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
