<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  &lt;p&gt;I have been think of setting up this site for a while now but I haven't had the time. But now that we are in social distancing because of the Corona Virus, I have all the free time to work on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The goal of this site is to document all of the process that I am going through to learn and relearn some of the things that interest me. That is why I have decided to host in on Github Pages. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The goal over the next few weeks:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Learn my Arduino&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Setup My Raspberry PI&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Learn Git&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Finish Studying for the Dynamics 0365 Certificate (Test is on the 24th)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Create this site and relearn how to use HTML and CSS. I am going for a CyberPunk aesthitic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually this site will move to Jekyyl as the CMS, but for the moment I am enjoying just making something simple in HTML and utilizing Sublime Text to craft the HTML and CSS like I did back and school. It is nice to have something simple and clean to work from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
