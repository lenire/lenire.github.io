I have finally started the conversion process of this baby site into Jekyll.

I have been playing a few video games lately, instead of working on my goals, but that is ok, as my brain did need the little bit of a break. 

Ready to get back into this tho, as it appears we have 3 more months of quarantine ahead of us.
