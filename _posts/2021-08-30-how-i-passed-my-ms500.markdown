How I Passed?

I started with the learn module on Microsoft as that gave me the basics I needed to cover. [learn modules]([hhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/m365-security-administrator/]) on Microsoft.com.

While studying for it, I did find this fantastic YouTube video featured below. It is 2 hours long, but covers everything really nicely.

This test was tougher than the other Microsoft Certifications I have taken in the past.

For this one, I did spend the time to go through and then try to configure my lab tenant to each of the items covered. I also took the Udemy course on MS-500, but I have paused it midway through as I am having to spend a lot of time studying Intune for work, which is a pretty tough subject, but with my new role I have a lot of customers performing Intune deployments.

On to the next certification, which I think will be the MS-203. I have taken a new role as an Engineer at work, and while I am comfortable with ExchangeOnline, there are a lot of migration projects and hybrid deployments I will be working through and that is currently something I know on a surface level and not indepth.
