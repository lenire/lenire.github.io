The year has come to a close. I have been meaning to write this post for a few days, but keep getting distracted with other things.

Last year there were lots of changes. I shfited roles at work and took on additional duties before getting a promotion into an engineer positition. I earned a couple of certifications to help with my specialized engineering role.

I earned the MS500 and the SC900 this past year. I have been studying for more certs and will be adding them to my portfolio.

I have been busy taking crash courses in migrations and Intune, with this new role, but my goals for 2022 are as follows:

1. Continue getting better with PowerShell
2. Earn a few more certifications( including some azure certs, maybe AWS, so I have some background there)
3. Learn Pearl (using the sololearn app)
4. Finally understand how intune works and better ways to troubleshoot it.
