True to my word. This week I took the deep dive to get more profecient at PowerShell. The first few chapters have been the basics about the commands and how they work tegether.

I am trying to avoid skipping these chapters even if they are basic, as there are a few fundamentals that are needed. 

I have never used the help page in powershell before. I do not think it is as well written as the Linux manuel pages, but it is a handy source instead of contastly Googling things to find the appropriate comandlet for the task at hand.

It has been good practice this week. I am midway through Chapter 4, but I took a break from it as I needed to work late on some additional year end tasks for work and some larger escalations.

On to another week and more learning.
